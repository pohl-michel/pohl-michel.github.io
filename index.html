								<h1>About me</h1>
							</header>
							<p>French AI researcher living in Oxford. Before moving to the UK, I lived in Japan for almost seven years, and I continue to learn Japanese when time allows. At Brainomix Limited, I develop and ship end-to-end machine learning and computer vision systems (e.g., CT-based respiratory phase classification) to support the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases. Previously, I researched deep generative modeling and deep learning-based natural language processing applied to finance at Sony Computer Science Laboratories, transformers and online learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks applied to sequential data forecasting in radiotherapy at the University of Tokyo, and probabilistic graphical models for optical character recognition at Idemia. I am passionate about building reliable ML systems for real-world use and conducting research on new learning algorithms. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss research, ML engineering, or related ideas.

								<h3>Deep generative modeling and NLP for finance @ <a href="https://www.sonycsl.co.jp/en/" target = "_blank" style="color: blue">Sony Computer Science Labs</a> (Tokyo, 2022)</h3>
								<p> I developed a method to compute time-dependent loadings in security factor models based on the optical-flow algorithm and trained a VAE to learn and visualize low-dimensional fund-month exposure embeddings, to support GPIF activities. I also researched NLP algorithms (including approaches using transformer-based language models such as BERT and MPNet) for various problems, such as fake news detection and greenwashing evaluation, to help Nomura Asset management assess corporate sustainability.</p>

								<h3>Cine-MR image forecasting with RNNs and transformers for latency compensation in radiotherapy @ The University of Tokyo (2017-2021, independent work until 2026)</h3>
								<p>I designed an algorithm to forecast future frames in dynamic chest and liver MR images, based on motion modeling with PCA and temporal dynamics prediction with RNNs trained online and transformer encoders, for safe MR-guided radiotherapy. The proposed approach is modular, interpretable, and can help overcome data scarcity, motion irregularity, and distributional shift between the training and test datasets for population models.

								<h3>External marker position forecasting using RNNs trained online for safer radiotherapy  @ The University of Tokyo (2020-2021, independent work until 2025)</h3>
								<p> I proposed implementations of online training algorithms for RNNs (UORO, SnAp-1, and DNI) with closed-form simplifications as well as improved accuracy and reduced time/memory complexity. I assessed their ability to forecast the positions of markers on the chest and abdomen for latency compensation and robotic control in radiotherapy for the first time. In our experiments, modern online learning algorithms enabled RNNs to adapt to irregular breathing patterns with limited data and achieve competitive accuracy compared to prior deep learning approaches trained on larger datasets, while keeping inference time relatively low.</p>

								<h3>Simultaneous segmentation and recognition of characters @ <a href="https://www.idemia.com/" target = "_blank" style="color: blue">Idemia</a> (Île-de-France, 2016)</h3>
								<p>I prototyped an OCR pipeline in C for degraded text images, consisting of three steps: over-segmentation, character recognition, and shortest-path graph decoding using Viterbi's algorithm to select the most likely string (see the figure above). It achieved 13.4% higher accuracy than the open-source OCR engine Tesseract 3.04. The first step of the pipeline (candidate cut generation) relied on Dijkstra's algorithm, as each pixel was assigned to a node in the graph representation of the image and edge weights were based on pixel intensities and heuristics; I optimized speed using a binary-search-style strategy. Regarding the second step, I implemented from scratch a character-level neural network classifier, trained it on a dataset of ~20k character images, and improved recognition accuracy by ~5% by incorporating a class-conditional Bayesian aspect-ratio prior.

								<h3>Graph-structured data classification for computer-aided diagnosis in neurology @ <a href="https://www.fresnel.fr/spip/" target = "_blank" style="color: blue">Fresnel Institute</a> (Marseille, 2016)</h3>
								<p> I first derived a generalized likelihood ratio test for binary classification of graph-structured data via Fourier graph transforms, based on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.10.026" target = "_blank" >prior work from Hu et al</a>. I applied this method to Alzheimer's disease detection, by modeling brain regions in PET images as nodes in a graph with edge weights defined by Gaussian RBF kernels over regional imaging features, and obtained a leave-one-out test F1 score of 0.78 on a dataset of 122 brain scans. Last, I explored optimization of region-independent weights corresponding to each image property to maximize classification accuracy. </p>

								<h3>Participation in the French robotics cup (2015)</h3>
								<p>I built and integrated two autonomous robots that execute actions on a table to score as many points as possible during 90-second matches, as part of a team of 6 students. Specifically, I focused on programming the Arduino microcontroller in C/C++, which includes motion control (proportional control), obstacle avoidance, and action sequencing. I also took part in project planning, communications, fundraising/partnerships, and mentoring junior students.</p>

								<p> I modeled a periodic inhomogeneous fiber-bundle structure using coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to study effective stiffness under different conditions. This supports our understanding of DNA degradation mechanisms due to irradiation, as part of the <a href="https://smmil-e.com/about/overview/" target = "_blank"> SMMIL-E project</a>, which promotes the development and use of BioMEMS against cancer. I estimated numerically the effective Young's modulus for chains of <i>n</i> repeated unit cells with a transfer-matrix formulation using MATLAB, and analyzed sensitivity to structural parameters. I also derived closed-form expressions for the effective modulus in simplified configurations, and characterized asymptotic regimes (weak/strong coupling and large-<i>n</i> behavior).

								<p>I developed a fluid flow mathematical model to assess the feasibility of a non-contact sensor measuring borehole vibrations and requiring less time and power compared with usual devices. I derived and interpreted analytical pressure and velocity expressions as a function of the wellbore vibration parameters in different scenarios using partial differential equations, Fourier analysis, and asymptotic expansions to back up the sensor design recommendations. </p>

He developed the ability to identify relevant problems quickly, find innovative solutions, prioritize tasks, communicate results effectively, and handle uncertainty. When talking with him, one can appreciate his sense of humor and modesty. He is a great engineer and computer scientist.</blockquote>

Michel proved to have very good skills as an engineer, and also as a physicist: he is brilliant, he is able to developing at the same time both original physical ideas and code implementations. Besides, he is a very committed and concerned collaborator. In addition to the above professional skills, I like to add that Michel is a very nice and pro-active person. It is a real pleasure to collaborate with him, since he is able to offer the best combination of original thought and attitude of a hard team work. </blockquote>

He attended my lectures on digital image processing and he was always asking me very interesting questions on the mathematical aspects of image processing. During the same year, I supervised his master's internship at Fresnel Institute on brain graph representation from positron emission tomography for computer-aided diagnosis purposes. Michel obtained very interesting results but unfortunately I was not able to obtain a scholarship to keep him working with me on a PhD subject. Michel is a very good scientist and he has all the skills to work either in a university or in a company. </blockquote>
